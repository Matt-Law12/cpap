Central Panhandle Aquatic Preserve (CPAP), located in Northwest Florida, is responsible for the management of four Aquatic Preserves: Alligator Harbor Aquatic Preserve (14,366 acres), Apalachicola Bay Aquatic Preserve (80,000 acres), St. Andrews Bay (25,000 acres), and St. Joseph Bay Aquatic Preserve (73,000 acres). CPAP began monitoring one station in the St Joseph's Bay system beginning in July 2005 at the Richardson's Hammock station. Station Windmark in St Joseph's Bay was added in August 2006 and discontinued September 2007. In October 2007 the Alligator Harbor datalogger site was added to the program. St. Joseph Bay Aquatic Preserve is unique in being the only body of water in the eastern Gulf of Mexico that is not influenced by the inflow of fresh water. This allows for clearer coastal waters with sandier sediments than in the north central Gulf of Mexico, making the bay an ideal habitat for seagrass communities. Alligator Harbor is a shallow system with consistent salinity levels and little freshwater flow which does not create the estuarine conditions characteristic of the waterbodies lying to the west, however the preserve contains seagrass habitat, oyster bars, beaches, saltmarshes, and bottom communities. The Apalachicola Bay Aquatic Preserve is located within the Apalachicola National Estuarine Research Reserve boundaries, and to avoid duplicative efforts, CPAP currently does not have dataloggers located in the Apalachicola Bay Aquatic Preserve. There are currently no datalogger stations in St. Andrews Bay Aquatic Preserve. CPAP is in the process of identifying additional dataloggers locations for St. Joseph Bay and St. Andrews aquatic preserves.
